## Description

Yahoo Fantasy Basketball allows players to build their "fantasy" NBA team and then each week a player will compete against another player in 9 different statistical categories. After the week is over, all players face against a different opponent for the following week. If player A is beating player B in a category then player A is awarded one point. If there are ties then no players get awarded a point. Therefore the most points a player can get in any given week is 9 points. 

While Yahoo Fantasy does provide a functionality to see how a player is doing against his/her opponent throughout the week, there isn't a functionality that provides a "what-if" scenario. To explain, if player A beats player B for week 1 how would player A know he/she would have fared against player C for that week? This is an helpful question especially if player A is facing player C the following week or the week after. 

What this application does is allow a player in my Yahoo Fantasy Basketball league to see how their team would have scored against any other player for any week. 

Web app uses React on the frontend and Django on the backend. Web app is hosted on EC2 via Elastic Beanstalk.
